### Description

Distributed as a commercial program, largely via computer magazine cover-mounted CD-ROMs and shareware downoad sites, This program will identify which lottery number formulae will work best in terms of highest return. A Must for any Lottery Player!. It calculates how much money you will lose! for arithmetic speed reasons, the engine for this program is in Microsoft Visual C++ and I have posted it in Planet's VC++ section. The program will run in any 32bit Visual Basic. This code demonstrates pretty much any VB app would be expected to do. Many users described this as CuriosityWare - Enjoy!
